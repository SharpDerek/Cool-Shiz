# Woo360 Albums

This was a plugin initially built for custom albums functionality here: http://50.28.33.104/~marianna/event-gallery/

## This plugin:
1) Registers an "Albums" Post Type
2) Creates a new Woo360/Beaver Builder Module that:  
  a) Dynamically creates a section in the module settings for each Album post  
  b) These settings allow you to customize the Title, Date, and Image for each post, as well as an option for whether or not you want to        include it.  
  c) It also has Global Settings for columns, colors, font families and sizes, letter spacing, and sexy sexy hover transitions.  
  
## Dependencies:
1) Woo360/Beaver Builder
