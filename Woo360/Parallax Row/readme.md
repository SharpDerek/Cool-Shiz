### How To Install:

### How To Use:
1) In the Woo360 Builder, add a new row or edit an existing row
2) In Style > Background, set 'Type' to 'SUPER Parallax'
  - This opens a new tab at the top called 'Super Parallax'
3) Add a background image for the row under Super Parallax > Background
4) Set a depth for the background (any value between 0 and 1, though lower is recommended here)
5) Add a Parallax Item by clicking 'Add Super Parallax Item', then clicking 'Edit Super Parallax Item' in the box that appears
6) For each Parallax Item:
  - Type a value in the 'Label' field to better organize your items in the builder
  - Add the parallax Item's image under Images > Photo
  - Add the depth of the image in the depth field (any value between 0 and 1)
  - Set the position of the image (Top Left, Bottom Center, etc.)
  - Toggle whether to hide the image on Mobile devices (recommended for very large images or anything that looks weird on mobile)
7) Add as many Parallax items as you want and position them however you like!
